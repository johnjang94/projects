            menu for the desktop PC (for the control of additional functions
            besides the smart glasses themselves) was located on the top of the
            session window.

            It was clear that some of the icons were similar in functions and
            more frequently used compared to some other icons that were
            different and not-so-important. Though, it seemed like the
            priorities nor the industry convention were not respected when those
            features were first created and been implemented.

            where they can reach out to others; and they had a menu where they
            can browse the history. On the other hand, the names for each menu
            were called as "RemoteVU", "GlassVU" or "ReportVU".

            The clinicians could click on each menu. When the names for each
            menu were confusing, there was no description on what the clinicians
            can do on each page. My team and I assumed that this would even
            delay their time in reaching out the patients because they need to
            know how to use the tool first, and it is possible that they might
            need to spend a significant number of hours just to get their feet
            wet first.

            From the main nagivation page, a couple of pages displayed lists of
            smart glasses devices that were associated with a particular
            clinician's account. In some ways, the people could check some level
            of information regarding the device. On the other hand, not all the
            information was clear to us other than the names of each device and
            to whom the devices belong to or in the possession of.

            From the information, we were able to notice that there was a button

            it was unclear how to initiate the call from the Desktop PC because
            we couldn't understand when the button is activated and ready for
            the call or not. From here, we have assumed that some of the
            clinicians might as well just give up on using the product.

            This page had only contained some information such as dates and

            was recorded or not, what is the summary in the call, etc. were all
            missing. From this page, we've assumed that the history page might
            not actually be useful to the clinicians because the history page
            does not contain the practically useful information prior to
            treating a patient.
