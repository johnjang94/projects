            <h3 class="learned1">What did we learn?</h3>
            <p class="lesson1_describe">
              My team and I have learnt that the login process was not as
              confusing to the clinicians who were interested in using the
              service. In fact, the client offers tutorial to the customers
              before the customers can practically use the service; therefore,
              the clinicians understand how to login.<br /><br />

              On the other hand, the client's customers still did not like the
              fact that the login was in two-steps. Basically, they felt that it
              was not necessary to click the "Sign in with another organization"
              button if they were still supposed to write their login id and
              password in the following screen. They said that one-step login
              process will do.

              It was difficult to navigate from one menu to another for the
              clinicians whilst they tried to engage with the product because
              the product was not interactive enough.

              Fact:<br /><br />
              Unlike what we had assumed, the client's customers did not
              encounter as much difficulty in navigating through the menus due
              to the tutorial. On the other hand, they still admitted that it
              takes time to be familiar with the menu names.

              The client's customers have confirmed that the buttons need to be
              re-organized. Since they already knew that one layer of menu is
              meant to control the Desktop PC and the other layer of menu is for
              the mobile screen that's also displayed on the Desktop PC, they
              were getting used to the controls. However, they have mentioned
              that there needs to be some work done in organization.
