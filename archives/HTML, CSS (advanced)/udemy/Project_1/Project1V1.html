						Parks Canada is the agency of the Government of Canada which 
						manages the country's 48 National Parks, three National Marine Conservation Areas, 
						172 National Historic Sites, one National Urban Park, and one National Landmark. 
						Parks Canada is mandated to "protect and present nationally significant 
						examples of	Canada's natural and cultural heritage, and foster public understanding, 
						appreciation, and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and 
						commemorative integrity for present and future generations".
					</p>
					<h3 class="heading-tertiary">Enjoy the live adventure like you've never been before</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						The agency also administers lands and waters set aside as 
						potential national parklands, including 10 National Park Reserves 
						and one National Marine Conservation Area Reserve. 
						More than 450,000 km2 (170,000 sq mi) of lands and waters in national parks 
						and national marine conservation areas has been set aside for such purposes.
						Parks Canada cooperatively manages a large majority of their protected areas 
						and heritage sites with Indigenous partners.
						The Canadian Register of Historic Places is supported and managed by the agency, 
						in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments and other federal bodies. 
						The agency is also the working arm of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board, 
						which recommends National Historic Sites, Events, and Persons.
